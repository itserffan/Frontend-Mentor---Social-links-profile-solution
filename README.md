## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design with CSS media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce responsive design principles and practice using media queries effectively. I designed the layout to adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes. Here’s a snippet of the CSS media query code that made this possible:

```css
/* Mobile screens (up to 600px) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    width: 90%;
    padding: 3.2rem;
  }
  /* Additional mobile styles */
}

/* Extra large screens (above 1400px) */
@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  .container {
    width: 40%;
    padding: 6rem;
  }
  /* Additional large screen styles */
}
```

### Continued development

I aim to further explore complex responsive design techniques, including CSS Grid and custom properties for theme management. Future projects may also involve more JavaScript to create interactive features for enhanced user engagement.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me structure my layout with Flexbox efficiently.
- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - MDN’s guide was instrumental in understanding and implementing a mobile-first approach to responsive design.
